# Window frame replacement

I created a timelapse video in the same way as described in [Lego mounted timelapse](../lego-mounted-timelapse/README.md). After that I used Blender to edit the video, shortening it and adding some night-skipping imagery.

[This is the result.](./replacement-timelapse.mp4)

The [video](./archive/video.mp4) created by combining the images and the [Blender file](./archive/edited-timelapse.blend) are also attached.
