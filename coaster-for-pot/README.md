# Coaster for pot

We had a pot that always left a wet spot on the windowsill. And I wanted to make a coaster for that. Nicest would be a personalized one.

1) We had a nice [family picture](family_picture.jpeg).
1) In [Krita](https://krita.org/) I extracted the people for the [coaster design](coaster.kra).
1) This was exported into a [PNG image](coaster_idea.png).
1) Which was converted to a [SVG file](coaster_idea.svg) with some online tool.
1) Importing this into [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) it could be used for a 3D design.

And it fits nicely below the pot.
