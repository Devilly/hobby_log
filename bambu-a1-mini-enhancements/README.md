# Bambu A1 mini 3D printed enhancements

After buying the [Bambu A1 Mini](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/nl-nl/products/a1-mini) I printed some enhancements to the machine and its usage:

* PTFE removal tool
    * https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/a1-mini/maintenance/ptfe-tube
* Cable clips
    * https://makerworld.com/en/models/41020
    * I prefer the non-tighter versions
* Poop bucket
    * https://makerworld.com/en/models/501368
* Carrying handle
    * https://makerworld.com/en/models/48599#profileId-62550
    * I picked the one with the hole on top of the handle
