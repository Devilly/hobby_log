# Pokémon battle cards container

My son and myself like to play the Pokémon card game these days, for which we have two decks and corresponding coins. This is my take on a way to store these in a single container.

The [container model](./container.scad) is created in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) with an [export to STL](./container.stl) also present.

For the text `Pokémon` on the lid I used the [Pocket Monk](./pocket-monk.zip) font ([online version](https://www.fontget.com/font/pocket-monk/)). I actually preferred the [Pokemon](./pokemon-1.zip) font ([online version](https://www.fontget.com/font/pokemon-1/)) but that didn't have support for the `é`.
