# Custom drawing plant pot

We needed a plant pot and I found the idea really cool to customize it. Therefore I got both of my kids to make a drawing and write their own names, after which I extruded these both from the plant pot.

See the [Blender file](./pot.blend) for the design. The STL is not attached as it was, according to Finder, `270.671.884 bytes (270,7 MB on disk)`.
